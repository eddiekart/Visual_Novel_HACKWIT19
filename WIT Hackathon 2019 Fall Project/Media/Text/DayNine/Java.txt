Yesterday was a lot of fun with [Java], I’m glad she invited me to join her club, but I don’t really know if I have what it takes.
Speak of the devil, here she is now.
[Java] Appears
[Java]: Hey [User]! Thank you for meeting me yesterday, it was a lot of fun.
[User]: I should be thanking you! 
[Java]: So, what’s your thoughts on joining?
[User]: Yeah! The club seems like a lot of fun, but I’m still not totally sure.
[Java]: How about we get lunch together tomorrow? At the roof of the school? The view’s pretty nice there.
[User]: Sure thing! I’ll see you there tomorrow.
[Java]: Okay! I’ll see you later.
