-Transition to classroom-

[???]: Is [user] here?
[User]: Yes, that’s me.

-Java face pops up in classroom background-

[???]: Hi, I’m the student council president, Java. Sorry I couldn’t show you around yesterday, I misplaced some objects into the wrong array, so that threw a lot of stuff around.
[User]: Oh that’s okay, I didn’t really get into any trouble *smiles*
[???]: Okay. Come! I’ll show you around…
[User]: Thank you President!
[???]: Please, call me Java

-Transitions to front of school-

[User]: The student council president introduced me to various departments and clubs around the school.
[User]: The school is bigger than I thought, I’m glad to have someone showing me around.
[Java]: And for our sports, we have tennis, track and field…..
[User]: Track and field?
[Java]: Are you interested?
[User]: Yeah...kinda... I’m just looking out for what clubs I should join.
[Java]: That’s great! …. It’s not exactly a club, but the student council can use someone as enthusiastic as you!
[User]: Really? Wouldn’t I be too inexperienced?
[Java]: Not at all!! We would love to have some fresh bloo….i mean some new students as members! We also have a club fair you can check out!
[User]: When is that going to be?
[Java]: It is in two days
[User]: That’s awesome! I’ll be there!
[Java]: That’s great to hear! In the mean time do you need anything else?
[User]: Can you show me where the library is again? I need to pick up some books for class.
[Java]: Sure thing [user]!
[User]: After Java showed me where the library is, we talked a little longer, mostly about how Java would love to have me on the student council President, and I went home
