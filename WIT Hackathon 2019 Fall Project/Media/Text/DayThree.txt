[User]: Second day of school! I wonder if I'll see that runner again today
-Classroom.png-
[???]: Is [User] here?
[User]: Yes, that's me.
-Java joins-
[Java]: Hi, I'm the student council president, Java Oracle. Sorry I couldn't show you around yesterday, I misplaced some objects in the wrong array, so that threw a lot of stuff around.
[User]: Oh, that's okay, I didn't really run into any trouble.
[Java]: Glad to hear it! Come on, I'll show you around!
[User]: Thank you President!
[Java]: Please, call me Java.
-Transitions to front of school-
The student council president spent the morning introducing me to various departments and clubs around the school.
[User]: The school is bigger than I thought, I'm glad to have someone showing me around.
[Java]: My pleasure! And for our sports, we have tennis, track and field!..
[User]: Track and field?
[Java]: Are you interested?
[User]: Yeah! Kinda... I'm just looking out for a club I might like to join.
[Java]: That's great! !. It's not exactly a club, but the student council could use someone as enthusiastic as you!
[User]: Really? Wouldn't I be too inexperienced?
[Java]: Not at all! We would love to have some fresh bloo!.i mean some new students as members! We also have a club fair you can check out!
[User]: When is that going to be?
[Java]: It's in just two days.
[User]: That's awesome! I'll be there!
[Java]: That's great to hear! In the meantime do you need anything else?
[User]: Can you show me where the library is again? I need to pick up some books for class.
[Java]: Sure thing [user]!
Afterwards, Java showed me where the library is, we talked a little longer, tt was mostly Java trying to recruit me to the student council, before I finally went home.
