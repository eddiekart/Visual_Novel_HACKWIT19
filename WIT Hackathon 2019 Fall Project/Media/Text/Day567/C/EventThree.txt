[User]: Hey, C! I'm here.
[C]: You've been coming here quite often, huh. You must be interested in books.
[User]: Yeah! I've been having fun here. 
[C]: Hehe, that's good.
[User]: I actually came here to do some work. I couldn't really concentrate at home, you see.
[C]: The library is great for that. I've got to finish my work, too. There's an assignment due tomorrow, but there's a project that was assigned before that, so I'm in a rush to finish that first, you see.
Choice:
Going through your work in order, I see. I try to do that too! It makes it easy to keep track of what I need to do next.
I see. That certainly is a good way to go through your work! I haven't done that before, but maybe I should give it a try.
Shouldn't you work on the assignment that's due tomorrow first? I feel like that's more important.

[C]: I'm glad someone understands! It does hold me up here and there, but it's just easier overall for me.
[C]: Yeah, you should give it a shot. It's nice once you get used to it.
[C]: Hey, it's worked for me in the past! I'm sure i'll pull through. Everyone has their own way of doing things, you know.
[User]: Well, I better get working. Good luck on your project!
[C]: Thanks!
