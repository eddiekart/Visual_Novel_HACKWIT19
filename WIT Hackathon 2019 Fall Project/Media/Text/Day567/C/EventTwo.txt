[User]: Hey, C! 
[C]: Oh, hey, [user]. How was the book?
[User]: It was pretty interesting, I think I understand it a bit now.
[C]: That's good. I gave up on understanding strings! I think i should be fine, though.
[User]: Hmm, ok. You have that quiz in a week or so too, right?
[C]: Yeah.. what about it?
[User]: I was wondering if you could quiz me on something we need to know. I want to be prepared.
[C]: Hmm! Well, here's one. What can you replace {} with?
Choice:
<%, %>! I was studying this last night!
Was it <:, :>?
That's such an easy question! You can't! What kind of dumb person would replace that with anything?
Reply:
[C]: Oh, you actually got it! That's correct.
[C]: Close, but not quite. That's for replacing [], you need <%,%> for {}.
[C]: ! There's more than one way to do anything, you know? You should go study a bit more.
[C]: Well, it's getting pretty late. I'm going to head home.
[User]: Ok! I'll see you later, then.
