[User]:I'll check the library. That person might have returned the book by now.

[???]: Oh, it's you.

[User]: Hey! Did you finish the book yet?
[C]: I tried, but I don't think I can understand strings after all. I'm C, by the way.
[User]: We never introduced ourselves, have we? Well, I'm User. Nice to meet you.
[User]: So, why were you looking for the String theory book?
[C]: I just didn't understand it in class! I can get to the character part, but I don't get how you put it all together.
[User]: Hey, everyone has different talents! Don't worry about it. I'm sure you'll find a way.
[C]: Hmm! What do you suggest? I've had some ideas, but I want to know what you're thinking.
Choice:
Maybe show it as a collection of characters? You know, like an array!
Hmm! I don't know, I'll read the book and get back to you on that.
I would go to the teacher and ask him to help with Strings. I'm not too familiar with it myself.
Response:
[C]: I guess! I'll try that. Well, here's the book. I'm a part of the book club, so if you have any more ideas, you can come find me here.
