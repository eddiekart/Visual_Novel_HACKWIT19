[User]: I wonder if Python is at the field again.

[User]: Huh, it seems like a race is going on. Python is running next! 
[User]: Python! You won!
[Python]: You were watching? Hehe, thanks! Everyone else was fixated on making really complicated training routines, and I think that threw them off a bit. I just followed the basics; simpler the better!
Choice:
It's easier to concentrate if it's simple, after all. Nice work!
Complicating it when you don't know how it works can be a negative, after all. Nice work!
I think optimizing everything is the ideal way to go, but hey, it worked for you I guess. Nice work!
Response:
[Python]: Hehe, thanks~~! I really worked hard for this. 
[Python]: Hehe, thanks~~! I really worked hard for this. 
[Python]: I guess? I don't think it works for me though. Thanks anyway.
[Python]: I'll be going to meet with my teammates. I'll catch you around!
[User]: All right. Have fun!
