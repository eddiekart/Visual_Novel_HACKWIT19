I decided to check out the Student Council
-Clubroom.jpg-
[User]: Hello? is this the student council?
-Java joins- 
[Java]: Hey [User], I'm so glad you came!
[User]: Huh, so this is the famous student council.
[Java]: Yep! In the flesh!
[User]: Everything is so organized and neat here.
[Java]: Yeah, I really like to structure things, it makes it much easier to access whatever I need. Although some people say I am a bit obsessive.
[User]: I think it's nice though, at least you know where everything is, you'll never lose anything.
[Java]: I know right! Actually, since you're here, I need some help.
[Java]: I have this book about cats here, where should I put it?
Choice:
Hmm, you should put it in the pet drawer, since cat is a pet
I think the animal drawer is fine
A cat belongs anywhere, so anywhere is fine!
Response:
[Java] That's a really good idea! Since cat is a subclass of pet afterall
[Java] I think that's okay 
[Java] Eh!.Eh??? Wouldn't putting cat with other pets make more sense? But I guess any object works.
[Java]: Thank you for your input
[User]: No problem!
[User]: I gotta run to class now, I will see you around?
[Java]: See you!!
