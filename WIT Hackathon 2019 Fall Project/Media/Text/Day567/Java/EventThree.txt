[User]: I don’t really know what to do now, maybe I’ll help Java with the club fair
-Club Room-
[User]: Java? Hello? Java? Is that you in the paper pile?
[Java]: *stumbles awkwardly* [User]? Hi! Umm….. I have a bit too much of club fair entries, but my drawers don’t have space for them. I tried stuffing them but that didn’t work.
[User]: That sounds rough.
[User]: *helps Java organize the request in a stack* So what do we do with these now?
[Java]: I’m not sure, we don’t have space in the drawers anymore
Choice:
We can report to the school that the entries are too much for the club room
We can try to get more drawers?
We can try to stuff them in the drawers again
Reply:
Yeah, maybe the school would know what to do with them
I don’t think the clubroom has any more space for drawers, let’s report this to the school 
The only way that can happen is if we remove some entries from the drawer. I think we should report this to the school
[User]: Okay, let’s go to the school then.
After reporting the problem to the school, we went back to the club room.
[User]: Thank goodness the school can lend us their room to store the entries
[Java]: Yeah, it was nice of them to do that
[Java]: Thanks [User], that was nice of you
[User]: I gotta run now, see you later?
[Java]: Yeah
