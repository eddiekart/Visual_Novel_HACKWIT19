[C]: Hey [User], thanks for coming up here to meet me!
[User]: Yeah of course, thanks for inviting me. I didn’t realize we had such an awesome view!
[C]: Yeah, but that’s not why I wanted to bring you here, I actually had a question!
[User]: Sure thing, what is it?
[C]: Well first, I wanted to know if you’d made up your mind yet?
[User]: Yeah, I think I really do want to join the book club!
[C]: Great! Well then about my question. If I’m going to recommend to let you in, I feel like we should know each other better. So I planned a fun little test!
[User]: Oh, ok. What did you have in mind? 
[C]: Alright, I just need you to answer one question about me, so.
[C]: I was given an int a, and I want to print out a+1, what should I do?
Choice:
***
-printf(a++);
***
-2
***
-printf(++a);
***
+1
Replies:
[C]: Mmm… That’s not quite right. Since a++ returns the old value of a, then increment it, so printf(a++) would just print a
[C]: Yes! That’s the correct answer, it’s such a small mistake that people usually get wrong. I’m impressed with how well you remember things!
