[Python]: Hey [User], thanks for coming up here to meet me!
[User]: Yeah of course, thanks for inviting me. I didn't realize we had such an awesome view!
[Python]: Yeah, but that's not why I wanted to bring you here, I actually had a question!
[User]: Sure thing, what is it?
[Python]: Well first, I wanted to know if you'd made up your mind yet?
[User]: Yeah, I think I really do want to join the track and field club!
[Python]: Great! Well then about my question. If I'm going to recommend to let you in, I feel like we should know each other better. So I planned a fun little test!
[User]: Oh, ok. What did you have in mind? 
[Python]: Alright, I just need you to answer one question about me, so.
[Python]: What would you use to get the squares of every even number from one to ten the fastest?
Choice:
***
new_list = []
for n in range(0, 10):
	if n % 2 == 0:
    		new_list.append(n**2)
(-2)
***
new_list = [n**2 for n in range(0,10) if n%2 == 0] (+1)
Replies:
[Python]: Mmm! That's not quite right. That's the slow way! You've got to be faster if you want to be in the track and field club, you know!
[Python]: Yes! I see that speed comes naturally to you! I'm glad!
