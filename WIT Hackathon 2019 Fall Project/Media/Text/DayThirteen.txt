Today’s the big day, the club fair is here and I finally have to pick a club to register for, I hope I’m making the right choice. After submitting my application, I walk around the fair for a short while, admiring all of the different booths and their activities before returning home. I can barely sleep tonight as I anxiously wait for tomorrow to hear if my application was accepted.
