Encounter with Python
-In bedroom-
[User:] Ok, first day, lots to do. I am up thirty minutes early, but I may as well head in to school now, if I get lost at least I will have extra time to figure out where I am.

-Transition to school, track view-

[User:] Oh, a field, and there are people running on it, looks like the track and field club? Maybe I should join them, would not be a bad idea to exercise

-Python comes into view-

[User]: The way that one is running, they have to be the captain or something.
There is something so elegant about how they run, it is a simple act, yet they seem so efficient, with no wasted movement.
[User]: Oh crap, they caught me staring.
[???]:  Heeeeeeeey!
[User]: Oh, uh, hey!  
You wave back clumsily. The runner leaps over hurdles with ease and you can not help but to look on in awe for a moment.
[User]: Maybe if I join the track team, I can be like that person as well? 

-Transition to school-

[User]: I was told that the student council president would show me around the school today, but I do not see them anywhere, I wonder if it will happen tomorrow, it will be a pain to figure out where everything is on my own.

-Transition to classroom

[User]: There are not many people here yet, maybe it is because I got here early, but the track team was pretty early themselves too.
[User]: This classroom is pretty big, looks like there will be a lot of people coming.

-Transition to school- 

[User]: Nothing eventful really happened today, but the track team seems like it might be fun to join. I was also told that the student council president shows the new students around, but I never got a chance to meet them.
[User]: Oh well, I got around well enough today, I guess I will just go home.
