It is. It was amazing to see you run past all of the others! I was really worried at the start when you were behind, but I knew you could do it! Omega good job!
I had fun watching! It was an exciting race.
It’s nice. I thought the race was over at the start when you fell behind, but I guess fortunate events happen! Good job!
Replies:
It was really nerve-wrecking when I passed them! I’m glad it’s over.
It was a close race indeed. Glad you had fun.
I guess… It could have turned out differently on another day, I suppose.
