[User]: I've finally moved out to live on my own! I'm so excited, I wonder what it's going to be like, and who I'm going to meet.
[User]: Tomorrow will be the first day of school, I hope it goes smoothly. Hopefully it goes well, I meet a bunch of new people and maybe even join a club! I guess I just have to wait and see.
[User]: Awe man but what kind of club do I want to join? Do I choose based on whose in the club? Or should I focus on my interests? Maybe I'll just join whatever club the friends I make are in, God I hope I can make some new friends.
[User]: Awe whatever, overthinking everything isn't going to help. I just have to finish packing and I'll go to sleep. Gotta make sure I'm at my best tomorrow to make a good impression!
