[C]: Hey [User]! Over here!
[User]: Hey C! 
[C]: Thanks for coming today! This is my favorite restaurant in town. The food is really nice, and the place is very organized as well!
[User]: I bet it is. Can't wait to eat. Anyways, what's the occasion for calling me out here?
[C]: You look like someone who really loves books and learning new things, I was thinking that you would be perfect for the book club! Care to learn more? And perhaps join it!
Choice:
Oh yeah, you did mention that you are in the book club. I would love to try it out, tell me more bout it!
I don't know. It sounds like a grand time, but I'm worried that it may take up too much time
Maybe, but it doesn't seem to suit me too well!
Reply: 
[C]: I'm so glad to hear that! Ok, so basically the book club is...
[C]: I understand, you have to focus on school after all. Though if you join the book club, I wouldn't mind helping you with school work!
[C]: That's ok, you can always come by if you decide to change your mind
We spoke for a little while longer, C seemed pretty excited about me joining though, I'll have to give her offer some more thought.
