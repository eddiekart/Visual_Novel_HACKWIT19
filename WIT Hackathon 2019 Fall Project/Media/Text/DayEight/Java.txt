[Java]: Hey [User]! Over here!
[User]: Hey Java! 
[Java]: Thanks for coming today! This is my favorite restaurant in town. The food is really nice, and the place is very organized as well!
[User]: I bet it is. Can't wait to eat. Anyways, what's the occasion for calling me out here?
[Java]: Oh, I was just wondering if maybe you were interested in the student council? You looked interested in the past couple days, coming to help us and all.
Choice:
It looked nice, I really like the work that you do and the impact you're making. Also I love how organized everything is with you
I don't know. It looks fun, but it's a bit different from what I've done before. I'm up for trying it out, though.
Maybe, but it doesn't seem to suit me too well!
Reply: 
[Java]: Thank you [User], that means a lot to me
[Java]: Yeah, it can look intimidating at first, but I think you'll find it's pretty easy to get the hang of.
[Java]: That's too bad, you would've been perfect for the student council
We spoke for a little while longer, Java seemed pretty excited about me joining though, I'll have to give her offer some more thought.
