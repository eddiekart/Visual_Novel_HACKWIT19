[User]: Hmm! I got a text.. Oh, It's from Python.
[User]: She wants to eat lunch with me today. I guess I have nothing else to do! might as well.

[Python]: Hey [User]! Over here!
[User]: Hey Python! 
-Python joins-
[Python]: Thanks for coming today! This is my favorite restaurant in town. The food is sooooo gooooood!.
[User]: I bet it is. Can't wait to eat. Anyways, what's the occasion for calling me out here?
[Python]: Oh, I was just wondering if maybe you were interested in the track and field club? You looked interested in the past couple days, coming to watch us and all.
Choice:
Yeah, it looked fun! The simple elegance of running seems like something I want to get into.
I don't know. It looks fun, but it's a bit different from what I've done before. I'm up for trying it out, though.
Maybe, but it doesn't seem to suit me too well!
Response:
[Python]: I totally agree! Over complicating things have never been my style, things should be easy to understand, and running is even easier!
[Python]: Yeah, trying out new things can be a little intimidating, but I think you'll find it's pretty easy to get the hang of.
[Python]: You sure? It's pretty fun you know! I'm sure you'll have fun if you try it out.
We spoke for a little while longer, Python seemed pretty excited about me joining though, I'll have to give her offer some more thought.
