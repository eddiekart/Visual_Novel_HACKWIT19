[User]: School is finally over! I think I'm getting used to the lessons, but extra studying won't hurt. If I remember right, the library was this way!

Mmm! It's a nice library. There's the help desk! Let's go ask where the book is.
[User]: Hello, where can I find the book [String Theory]?
[Library person]: It should be in that section of the library.
[User]: Thank you!
[User]: String! string! Not char! Ah! Here it is. I'm glad it's there.

[???]: String theory! I wanted that!
[User]: Oh, were you looking for the same book? It doesn't look like they have a second copy! you can borrow it before me.
[???]: Really? Thanks, I'll try my best to return the String in one piece, not a character array.
-C leaves-
[User]: I guess I can try to come back sometime to see if the book is still there. For now, I might as well go home.
