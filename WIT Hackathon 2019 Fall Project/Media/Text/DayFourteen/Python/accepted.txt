I can hardly wait to find out if I got into the club! I should hurry to school.

[Python]: Hey! [User], over here! 
[User]: Oh hey Python, any news on my club application?
[Python]: Actually, yes! I wanted to be the one to tell you that!
[Python]: You're totally in! 
[User]: That's great news! I'm excited to try it out.
[Python]: You'll have to take it seriously, you know? Track and field is rewarding but it's not all fun and games, it takes practice like anything else to get good at.
[User]: Of course, I'll be doing my best.
[Python]: Great! I'm glad you will get to spend more time with me, Python, the far superior coding language that the game devs are only slightly biased towards!
[User]: Oh! Uh, yeah, sure.
[Python]: Yay!
From then on, I was a member of the track and field club and slowly but surely my skills improved over time. Python helped me out with simple tips and tricks.
