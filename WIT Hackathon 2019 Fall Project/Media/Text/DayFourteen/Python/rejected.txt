I can hardly wait to find out if I got into the club! I should hurry to school.

[User]: Hey Python!
[Python]: Oh, hey [User].
[User]: Any news about my club application yet?
[Python]: Yeah… I’m sorry [User], but it looks like we don’t have any room in the club for you this year.
[User]: Oh, that’s a bummer. I was really excited too.
[Python] Yeah, maybe you can try again next year? We can still see each other around school every now and then, right?
[User]: Yeah, I guess you’re right.
I never got much more familiar with Python passed a friendly smile and wave every now and then, but I guess you can’t always be friends with everybody. There’s always next year!
