I can hardly wait to find out if I got into the council
I should hurry to school.

-Java joins-
[User] Oh hey, Java! How are you doing?
[Java] Fine, I guess.
[User] Any news on my application?
[Java] I actually haven't checked it yet.
[Java] Do you want to see it together?
[User] Sure!
Enthusiastically, I sat down with Java and checked the result.
I did not get in.
I'm disappointed. But more importantly, I'm embarrassed before the student council president.
[Java] I'm so sorry.
[User] It's fine. I'm a new student here after all... 
[User] It'd be out of the norm for me to join the student council so quickly.
[Java] Don't put yourself down like that!
[Java] I think you got rejected because the other members don't know you that well yet.
I know that Java is trying to comfort me, but I'm still sad I didn't get in.
[User] Well, I can always try again next year, right?
[Java] Exactly! Tell you waht, if you keep helping us, I'm sure the other members will get to know you.
[Java] That way, you're basically guaranteeed to get in next time!
I smile, feeling a little more hopeful now.
[User] Sounds great. I'll be seeing you here and there, then, president!
[Java] Of course!
